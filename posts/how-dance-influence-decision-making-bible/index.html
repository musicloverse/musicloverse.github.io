But have you ever wondered what influences these decisions? In this article, we will delve into the science behind decision making and explore the various factors that impact the choices we make.\nDecision Fatigue: The Impact of Exhaustion on Decision Making One interesting concept that has been discovered is decision fatigue. Similar to how our physical muscles can become tired after repetitive use, our minds also experience fatigue after making numerous decisions throughout the day. Studies have shown that decision fatigue can lead to a decrease in our willingness to make decisions. In fact, it has been found that judges are more likely to award parole early in the morning or immediately after taking a break, as decision fatigue sets in as the day progresses.\nSerotonin Levels: The Key to Tackling Difficult Decisions Another influential factor on decision making is our serotonin levels. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter in our brain, plays a crucial role in regulating our mood and emotions. Studies have shown that higher levels of serotonin are associated with a willingness to tackle difficult decisions and take higher risks. Conversely, as our serotonin levels decline throughout the day, we are more likely to avoid making decisions. To optimize decision making, experts recommend scheduling major decisions before 11:00 a.m. and increasing serotonin levels through exposure to sunlight, exercise, and a nutritious diet.\nUnmet Needs and Thirst Influence Decision Making Have you ever noticed that when you’re hungry or thirsty, you tend to make different choices? This is because unmet needs, such as hunger and thirst, can significantly impact decision making. When we have unmet needs, such as hunger, we are more likely to make choices that fulfill those needs, even if it means purchasing more than we initially intended. Similarly, studies have shown that when we are thirsty, we are more willing to take greater risks. It is essential to be aware of our physiological needs and how they can influence our decision making.\nThe Power of Language and Reframing Decisions Did you know that the language we use can affect our decision making? Studies have found that if we reframe our decisions in a foreign language, we are more likely to make rational choices. This is because when we use our primary language, emotions are often intertwined with the decision-making process. Reframing decisions in a foreign language removes some of the emotional aspects, enabling us to make more rational choices. So, if you are multilingual, consider reframing major decisions in a foreign language to optimize your decision-making skills.\nExternal Influences and the Art of Designing Better Choices While we like to believe that our decisions are based on careful thought and consideration, external influences often play a significant role in shaping the choices we make. Richard H. Thaler, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics, emphasizes that our decisions are often influenced by defaults, particular options presented to us, and external circumstances. For example, a study conducted on organ donation rates in different countries found that the way the choice was presented (opt-in or opt-out) significantly impacted the decision to donate. By recognizing our cognitive limitations and external influences, we can strive to design a better world that aligns with our true preferences.\nSeeking God’s Guidance: The Ultimate Source of Wisdom In light of the limitations of our decision-making skills, it becomes crucial to seek guidance beyond ourselves. The Bible teaches us that trusting in the Lord and seeking His will can lead us to make better decisions. Proverbs 3:5-8 reminds us to not solely rely on our own understanding, but to fear the Lord and turn away from evil. By acknowledging that God alone has the ability to see the past, present, and future, we can rely on His wisdom to guide our decisions.\nConclusion In conclusion, the science behind decision making reveals that various factors influence the choices we make. From decision fatigue to serotonin levels, unmet needs, language, and external influences, our decision-making skills are shaped by numerous elements. By recognizing these influences and seeking guidance beyond ourselves, we can strive to make better choices that align with our values and aspirations. By trusting in the Lord and relying on His wisdom, we can find the path that leads us to healing and strength in our decision-making journey.\n","wordCount":"736","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carson Matney"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://musicloverse.github.io/posts/how-dance-influence-decision-making-bible/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Music Loverse","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://musicloverse.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Music Loverse (Alt + H)"><img src=https://musicloverse.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Music Loverse</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>What Influences Your Decisions: Exploring the Science Behind Decision Making</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 4, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;736 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Carson Matney</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#decision-fatigue-the-impact-of-exhaustion-on-decision-making>Decision Fatigue: The Impact of Exhaustion on Decision Making</a></li><li><a href=#serotonin-levels-the-key-to-tackling-difficult-decisions>Serotonin Levels: The Key to Tackling Difficult Decisions</a></li><li><a href=#unmet-needs-and-thirst-influence-decision-making>Unmet Needs and Thirst Influence Decision Making</a></li><li><a href=#the-power-of-language-and-reframing-decisions>The Power of Language and Reframing Decisions</a></li><li><a href=#external-influences-and-the-art-of-designing-better-choices>External Influences and the Art of Designing Better Choices</a></li><li><a href=#seeking-gods-guidance-the-ultimate-source-of-wisdom>Seeking God&rsquo;s Guidance: The Ultimate Source of Wisdom</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XrumZ9y8OIc style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In our daily lives, we are constantly making decisions, from the moment we wake up to the choices we make throughout the day.
