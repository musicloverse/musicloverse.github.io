Whether you’re a seasoned EDM enthusiast or a curious beginner, this article will provide you with a crash course on the different types of music you’ll hear at EDM raves and festivals. We’ll showcase sample songs from each genre to give you a better understanding of how they sound and provide recommendations for DJs and podcasts to explore further. Let’s embark on this musical journey together!\nHouse Music: Rhythm and Beat\nHouse music, the first genre we’ll explore, is all about rhythm and beat. Unlike many other EDM genres, it focuses less on big drops and more on creating a danceable groove. Within the realm of house music, there are numerous subgenres, each with its distinct style. Some examples include big room house, electro house, tech house, progressive house, deep house, and tribal house. To illustrate the diversity of house music, we’ve curated a selection of sample songs from different subgenres. DJs like Carl Cox, Fisher, Chris Lake, Malaa, Tchami, Dombresky, Dr. Fresch, Jamie Jones, and Hot Since 82 are worth exploring if you’re interested in house music. Additionally, podcasts such as “Treasured Tape” by Michael Calfan and “Toolroom Radio” by Mark Knight offer valuable insights into the genre.\nTrance: Melodic and Euphoric\nTrance, the next genre on our list, encompasses a wide range of styles and subgenres. From uplifting trance to hard trance, classic trance to acid trance, and psytrance, there’s something for everyone within the realm of trance music. Trance can be characterized by its melodic, euphoric, and sometimes ethereal sound. Notable trance DJs include Above \u0026 Beyond, Armin Van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, Simon Patterson, Ace Ventura, Astrix, and Vini Vici. Podcasts like “A State of Trance” by Armin Van Buuren and “Group Therapy” by Above \u0026 Beyond provide a deeper dive into trance music and its subgenres.\nDubstep: Bass-Heavy Energy\nDubstep, loved by many for its heavy bass and energetic vibe, takes center stage in the next part of our guide. Featuring bold, melodic, and vocal-driven songs, this genre has a unique sound that often ignites the crowd at festivals. Prominent dubstep DJs include Excision, Virtual Riot, Subtronics, Svdden Death, Blunts \u0026 Blondes, Zeds Dead, Zomboy, Ganja White Knight, and Bassnectar. To experience the full force of dubstep, we recommend listening to live sets from these talented DJs. Don’t forget to check out podcasts like “Dead Beats Radio” and “Zomboy’s Rott N’ Roll Radio” for more dubstep goodness.\nDrum and Bass: Unmistakable Signature Beat\nDrum and Bass, often abbreviated as DNB, is a genre characterized by its distinctive beat and high energy. Subgenres within drum and bass include drum and bass vocal, liquid DNB, jungle, and jump-up. Notable DNB DJs include Andy C, Pendulum, Chase \u0026 Status, Netsky, Sigma, Noisia, Subfocus, and Camo \u0026 Krooked. If you want to explore the full breadth of drum and bass, podcasts like “Corsten’s Countdown” and “Open Up” by Simon Patterson offer a diverse range of styles within the genre.\nTrap Music: A Unique Blend of Hip-Hop and EDM\nTrap music, a genre that blends elements of hip-hop and EDM, stands out with its distinctive sound. Though not as diverse in subgenres as other genres, trap music offers a unique sonic experience. Artists such as Slander, Skrillex, and Diplo are known for producing trap music alongside other genres. While it can be challenging to pinpoint specific trap DJs, RL Grime, Nghtmre, Aero Chord, Baauer, Yellow Claw, Flosstradamus, and Slander are worth checking out for some trap goodness.\nFuture Bass: A Genre of its Own\nFuture Bass defies classification into traditional EDM genres and deserves recognition as a standalone genre. With its distinct sound and style, future bass offers a refreshing musical experience. DJs like Illenium, Seven Lions, San Holo, and Slander are known for their contributions to the future bass genre. To get a taste of future bass, we recommend listening to sample songs and live sets from these artists.\nHard Dance Music: Euphoric Melodies and Raw Energy\nHard dance music, including hardstyle, euphoric hardstyle, happy hardcore, and hardcore, provides a range of styles catering to different tastes. Euphoric hardstyle focuses on uplifting melodies, while rawstyle offers a more raw and edgy sound. Happy hardcore, known for its faster pace and melodic elements, and hardcore, with its intense and aggressive beats, offer unique experiences within the genre. Prominent DJs in the hard dance music scene include Da Tweekaz, Atmozfears, Code Black, Rebellion, Malice, Lil Texas, SEFA, Angerfist, and Darren Styles. The “Keeping The Rave Alive” podcast hosted by Kutski covers a broad spectrum of hard dance music and is an excellent resource for diving deeper into the genre.\nTechno: Rhythm, Beat, and Immersive Journeys\nTechno, often incorrectly used as an umbrella term for various genres, has its distinct sound and style. Similar to house music, techno focuses on rhythm and beat, taking listeners on an immersive journey. DJs such as Nicole Moudaber, Carl Cox, Richie Hawtin, Adam Beyer, Nina Kravis, Green Velvet, and Charlotte De Witte excel in the techno scene. Podcasts like “Drumcode Radio” by Adam Beyer and “AM/FM” by Chris Liebing delve into the world of techno, showcasing its unique sound.\nConclusion: Dive into the Richness of EDM\nWith this beginner’s guide to EDM genres and subgenres, we hope to have sparked your curiosity and provided a starting point for your exploration of the vibrant world of electronic dance music. From house to trance, dubstep to drum and bass, trap to future bass, hard dance music to techno, there’s a vast array of genres and subgenres waiting to be discovered. Remember to listen to sample songs, check out live sets from your favorite DJs, and delve into podcasts to deepen your understanding of these genres. Whether you’re a seasoned EDM enthusiast or a curious beginner, there’s something for everyone in the diverse landscape of electronic dance music.\n","wordCount":"999","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"William Yenz"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://musicloverse.github.io/posts/house-vs-edm-vs-techno/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Music Loverse","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://musicloverse.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Music Loverse (Alt + H)"><img src=https://musicloverse.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Music Loverse</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Beginner's Guide to EDM Genres and Subgenres: Exploring the Different Types of Electronic Dance Music</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 10, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;999 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;William Yenz</div></header><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fcXJBxsMMsM style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>In this comprehensive guide, we will dive into the diverse world of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and explore the various genres and subgenres that exist within this vibrant music scene.
