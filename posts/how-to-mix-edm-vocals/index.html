Mixing vocals is a crucial aspect of any EDM production, as it can make or break the overall impact and quality of your track. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you will learn how to create a Martin Garrix level vocal mix that stands out in the EDM genre.\nKey Points: Importance of using a reference track Using a referencing plugin to compare vocals Applying EQ and compression to match the dynamics and tone of the reference track Enhancing stereo width and adding reverb and delay for depth and space Automating gain to emphasize certain words or phrases Step-by-Step Guide Step 1: Choosing a Reference Track When mixing vocals, it is crucial to use a reference track to guide your process. Find a reference track where the vocalist has the same gender and a similar vocal range as your own track. Choose a reference track from a successful artist in the genre, such as Martin Garrix. In this case, the reference track used is “Starlight” by Martin Garrix.\nStep 2: Using a Referencing Plugin To compare vocals with the reference track, use a referencing plugin such as ADPTR Metric AB. Load the Martin Garrix track into the plugin and loop specific sections of the vocal where there are fewer instruments or distractions. This allows you to focus solely on the vocal mix and compare it with your own vocals. By using a reference track, you can ensure that your vocal mix maintains a professional and balanced sound.\nStep 3: Applying EQ and Compression Before diving into EQ and compression, it is recommended to first add a simple low-cut filter to remove any unwanted low-end rumble or sub-frequencies from the vocal recording. This ensures a cleaner and more focused vocal sound.\nNext, use a compressor to match the volume and dynamics of the reference track. Listen back and forth between the two tracks, adjusting the compression settings until the volume and dynamics are in line with the reference. Be careful not to over-compress, as it can negatively impact the natural sound of the vocals.\nStep 4: Fine-Tuning the Tone with EQ After achieving a balanced volume and dynamics, it’s time to focus on the overall tone of the vocals. Open an EQ plugin after the referencing plugin to analyze the frequency spectrum of both the reference track and your vocals. Make adjustments to the EQ settings, such as boosting or reducing specific frequency bands, to match the tone of the reference vocals.\nDivide the frequency spectrum into different bands and compare the volume and tone of each band between the reference track and your vocals. Make necessary adjustments, such as reducing low mids or boosting high frequencies, to achieve a comparable tonal balance. Experiment with different EQ settings and presets to find the optimal sound.\nStep 5: Addressing Harsh Frequencies While fine-tuning the tone, it is important to address any harsh frequencies that may be present in the vocals. Use a dynamic EQ plugin to target and reduce resonant frequencies in the mid-range. Adjust the settings to reduce harsh frequencies between 1000 to 2000 Hz to achieve a smoother and more pleasing vocal sound.\nStep 6: Adding Saturation and De-Essing To add brightness and crispness to the vocals, use a saturation plugin on the high frequencies. Saturation can add harmonics and enhance the overall clarity of the vocals. Be mindful not to overdo it, as it may result in harsh S sounds. After adding saturation, apply a de-esser plugin to control the excessive sibilance and reduce any harshness caused by the added brightness. Adjust the threshold to find the right balance of de-essing.\nStep 7: Creating Stereo Width and Adding Depth To create a wider stereo image, apply a stereo widening plugin to the vocals. However, be cautious not to overdo it, as it can compromise the natural character of the vocals. Use a subtle amount of stereo widening to add a sense of space and depth to the vocal mix.\nFor added depth and space, insert a short plate reverb plugin on the vocal track. Adjust the mix to a lower percentage, around 10%, and set a short decay time of around half a second. To maintain clarity, cut off the extreme low and high frequencies. This small touch of reverb can create a sense of ambiance and space around the vocals.\nStep 8: Automating Gain To emphasize certain words or phrases in the vocals, use a gain plugin that can be automated throughout the track. By automating the gain, you can selectively increase or decrease the volume of specific words or phrases, adding dynamic variation to the vocal mix. Experiment with automation to achieve the desired emphasis and impact.\nConclusion Mixing vocals is a critical step in achieving a professional-grade EDM production. By using reference tracks, applying EQ and compression, addressing harsh frequencies, adding saturation and de-essing, creating stereo width, adding depth with reverb and delay, and automating gain, you can achieve a Martin Garrix level vocal mix. Remember to trust your ears and make adjustments based on the specific needs and characteristics of your vocals. With practice and experimentation, you can develop your own unique vocal mixing techniques and elevate the overall quality of your EDM productions.\n","wordCount":"900","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Adrianne Burlett"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://musicloverse.github.io/posts/how-to-mix-edm-vocals/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Music Loverse","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://musicloverse.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Music Loverse (Alt + H)"><img src=https://musicloverse.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Music Loverse</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://musicloverse.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How to Mix EDM Vocals: A Comprehensive Guide to Achieving a Martin Garrix Level Vocal Mix</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 2, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;900 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Adrianne Burlett</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#key-points>Key Points:</a></li><li><a href=#step-by-step-guide>Step-by-Step Guide</a><ul><li><a href=#step-1-choosing-a-reference-track>Step 1: Choosing a Reference Track</a></li><li><a href=#step-2-using-a-referencing-plugin>Step 2: Using a Referencing Plugin</a></li><li><a href=#step-3-applying-eq-and-compression>Step 3: Applying EQ and Compression</a></li><li><a href=#step-4-fine-tuning-the-tone-with-eq>Step 4: Fine-Tuning the Tone with EQ</a></li><li><a href=#step-5-addressing-harsh-frequencies>Step 5: Addressing Harsh Frequencies</a></li><li><a href=#step-6-adding-saturation-and-de-essing>Step 6: Adding Saturation and De-Essing</a></li><li><a href=#step-7-creating-stereo-width-and-adding-depth>Step 7: Creating Stereo Width and Adding Depth</a></li><li><a href=#step-8-automating-gain>Step 8: Automating Gain</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wqo48VfK-r8 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpf7y2nE14o"><img loading=lazy src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tpf7y2nE14o/maxresdefault.jpg alt="Big Z"></a></p><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In this article, we will explore the techniques and process behind mixing EDM vocals to achieve a professional-grade vocal mix, using Martin Garrix&rsquo;s vocal mix as a reference.
